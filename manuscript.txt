Problem Formulation:
It has proven very difficult for NFL teams to properly identify which free agent
running backs should be considered premium targets. My goal is to create a model
to project the future success of NFL running backs based on their previous 
statistics. I will compare several different models and combinations of
variables to determine the best way to evaluate running backs.
